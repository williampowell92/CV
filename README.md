I'm an ex-enginner who's packed it all in to pursue his passion for coding at Makers Academy. I'm now an aspiring full stack developer.

I've spent the last few years designing, analysing and managing teams on projects such as the NPRV (Boaty-McBoatface) and HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain's newest and largest ever aircraft carrier.

I now want to apply my analytical mind, and problem solving skills, to a brand new career.

## Skills

#### Analytical mind

I've always had a curiosity to find out how things work. I've applied this to all parts of my life, education, and work. Through this I have developed a very logical and methodical way of thinking and breaking down problems.

- At Houlder I have developed, from scratch, a probabilistic operational model for analysing the capabilities of the United Kingdom General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA) fleet. I presented this to the Department for Transport and it was used as the key tool in the GLA 2015 fleet review.
- At university I led a team who carried out the basic design of a new jack up vessel, we tackled multiple design decisions throughout the process and came out with the second highest mark in the class.

#### Quick to learn

Throughout my engineering education and career I have taken every new learning opportunity that I has been made available for me. As a result of this I am now able to take on new technologies and learning practices rapidly. I hope to continue to develop this skill through Makers and my developer career.

- Learned every software used by my team at Houlder allowing me to assist in a wide range of jobs throughout my career.
- Became leading user on multiple softwares, because of this I was able to develop the company new drawing templates, word templates and was in high demand throughout my company.
- Avoided specialising, instead focusing on learning everything on offer, to be able to deliver maximum benefit to my team.

#### Project management

I have led multiple projects both at work and during my education. Through this I have developed strong organisational and communication skills.

- Spent over four months on multiple offshore construction projects, both as quality manager and project manager. The projects returned my companies highest profits for the fiscal year.
- Managed a team of four on the design of a thames river bus boarding pontoon, for a new housing development. All delivery deadlines on the project were met and the project was delivered under budget.
- Was picked by my team at university to lead my masters final project. We achieved the second highest result in my class.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (March 2018 to July 2018)

A highly selective, 16 week, intensive coding bootcamp. The course is focuses on writing well-written, easy to understand and maintain code. This is achieved through constantly applying best practices, including:

- Pair-programming
- Ted driven development
- Object oriented design
- Agile development

Throughout the course I have leapt at every opportunity to learn something new, covering technologies such as:

- Languages: Ruby, Javascript (including React), Java, HTML/CSS
- Web Frameworks: Sinatra, Node.js/Express, Spring Boot
- Databases: PostgreSQL
- Testing Suites: Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Cypress, Nightwatch, JUnit
- CI/CD tools: Travis CI, Docker, Heroku

#### Newcastle University (2011 to 2015)

- MEng (Hons) Naval Architecture
- 1st Class Honours
- Naval Architecture Award - top course graduate of 2015.
- Tachmindji Award - best overall performance in hydrodynamic subjects over two years.
